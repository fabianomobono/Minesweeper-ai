# Minesweeper-ai
Minesweeper-ai using knowledge base


This is an AI that solves a Minessweeper game. 
The Ai will try to make predictions about the future using a knoledge base that helper functions will populate with information based on the last move. 
The AI will then choose the best possible move.

Keep in mind that the AI will not always win, since Minesweeper requires a certain amount of guessing if there are no possible safe moves left to make.
